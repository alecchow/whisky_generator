## Introduction
Hi! this is my first attempt for the message generator project, part of my codecademy full-stack engineer course. This is also my first attempt at writing README in Markdown format and uploading my local repo to GitHub. Feel free to leave comments about my code or style. Any suggestion are most welcomed.

## Goal
A simple random message generator program build using JavaScript and Git version control.

---

## Objectives
1. Produces an output message that constitutes at least **3 different components**. 
2. Each component generates its own random piece of data.
3. Log the message by stitching the 3 parts together.
4. Use Git version control through out the project.
5. Develop locally and upload to GitHub upon completion.

---

## Technologies
* Bash,
* Git,
* GitHub,
* Markdown,
* Node,
* JavaScript

---

## Timeline
1. Create new local directory (folder) `mkdir whisky_generator`
2. Initialise the local repo `git init`
3. Create readme file `touch README.md`
4. Create script.js file and use Node to test the file is working
5. Git add and commit to create main branch (add & commit regularly afterward)
6. Compile a 3-parts message and build a database using nested array
7. Build random index generator with Math.random
8. Create empty array for the 3-parts message
9. Create loop using switch to generate different part of the message
10. Stich the output array together using `.join()`
11. Log the message on the screen
